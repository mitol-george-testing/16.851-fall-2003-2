One of the key products of this course is a personal portfolio. The portfolio provides both a personal reflection on the learning experience as well as a central collection of the tools and reference material from the course. The portfolio should contain:

1.  Your learning objectives for the class.
2.  Your reflections on the learning experiences with respect to the learning objectives.
3.  All of the tools you developed, including particularly the software modules and the problem sets and their solutions you or others developed.
4.  Web sites and reference material you found useful.
5.  Whatever else would be useful for your review of the subject.

The portfolio format is up to you to choose but it should be well organized. It may be captured on paper or electronically in a computer file or on a Web site. You will turn in the portfolio (or provide a URL) for grading three times during the semester.

The table below contains samples of various student portfolio formats. The student work is courtesy of the students listed below.
